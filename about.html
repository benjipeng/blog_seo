<p><b>"Code Optimizer"</b> - This name communicates the idea that this blog is about optimizing code, which could apply to both programming and SEO. The term 'optimizer' gives a nod to SEO practices while 'code' connects directly with programming.</p>

<p><b>"Semantic Sequencers"</b> - 'Semantic' is a term used in both SEO (as in semantic search, where search engines try to

code). 'Sequencers' could suggest the sequencing of code in programming.</p>
